[The FBI requested to delay today's trial against Apple, and it's been accepted.](http://www.theverge.com/2016/3/21/11279714/fbi-iphone-apple-trial-delay)

The reason? Apparently an outsider has come to the aid of the FBI to unlock the iPhone that they claimed they couldn't without a backdoor from Apple, and they say if it proves successful they will no longer need Apple's help and so the whole trial can be cancelled.

To me, it seems that the FBI thought they might lose and so decided to save themselves the embarrassment, but doing this so late in the game screams embarrassment itself.

But lets give them the benefit of the doubt, lets believe that someone has gone to them with a way to unlock that iPhone. The trial should still go ahead.

Why? Because as it has already been discussed, we've been here, at the so called "crypto wars" before, and if not now it'll come around again.

Apple, and other companies such as WhatsApp have already expressed during this ordeal that they have future plans to strengthen their encryption even further, so who's to say the method the FBI have access to now will work on iOS 10?

It's an important discussion that quite rightly Apple stated needs to take place in congress and its a discussion the whole world needs to take part in and have, it shouldn't just be tossed out because the FBI *say* that they can now unlock the iPhone.

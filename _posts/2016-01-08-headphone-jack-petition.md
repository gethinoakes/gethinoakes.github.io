## Back Story
There are rumours going around that Apple is going to get rid of the 3.5mm headphone jack in the iPhone in the next release (iPhone 7 if history is anything to go by).

## The Petition
I just stumbled across a pretty ridiculous petition that as I write this has 217,056 signatures. It's titled [Apple is ditching the standard headphone jack to screw consumers and the planet](https://action.sumofus.org/a/iphone-headphone-jack/)". And it's pretty fucking stupid.

Apple doesn't ditch technology to screw over their millions of consumers... or the planet. They do it because they believe that the technology has had its day and it's time to move on to better things. I won't pretend to know all about the headphone jack or how using the lightning connector would offer better sound output, but the fact is the headphone jack is old. It's been around for as long as I can remember and if Apple is going to get rid of it they do so hoping to make their devices better.

Apple's done the same thing in the past which also made people moan, such as getting rid of the floppy drive, cd drive, 30-pin connector etc. This petition may as well be asking all companies, not just Apple, to stop. Keep the devices they have now and not to change them, to stop innovating and that where we are now with technology is fine.

If it does happen, people will most likely be able to get an adapter for their headphones so they can use the lightning connection which wont cost much. And if they can't, then Apple will surely provide new bluetooth or lightning connected EarPods with the iPhone 7. And even if that doesn't happen, anyone can get a pair of bluetooth earphones off Amazon for about Â£20, which if you spend all that money on an iPhone you can't really complain about.

I'm an Apple fanboy, I love the company. But my opinion here isn't based on that. I agree with the decision and I don't have any problem the headphone jack going away on iPhones and eventually other technology. If it was Samsung making this move I'd still agree.

At the end of the day though, Apple probably wont change their plans because 200,000 signed a petition.

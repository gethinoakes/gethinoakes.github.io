I mentioned in my previous post the goals I have for 2016 and one of the major themes was that I just want to make stuff. I then came across [Justin Jackson's](https://twitter.com/mijustin) [2016 Maker Challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/) which is great because it's creating a community of people with the same goal.

Justin's challenging himself to create 100 things in 2016, which to me is pretty impressive. My list is much smaller, as I'm just getting back into creating things and have several unfinished projects I'd rather not set myself too big of a challenge that I end up failing because I feel overwhelmed. My hope is that as I get going and get stuff done I'll be able to add more if there's time left in the year.

It's refreshing to see that people joining [The 2016 Maker Challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/) have listed that they are going to create things such as blog posts. At first seeing things like that listed had me a bit confused, as in my mind such things didn't constitute as creating something. But that's the thing I'm trying to get to grips with is that writing a blog post is creating something. It's part of you, putting what's in your head out there and it's your content, not content that you've consumed.

It's refreshing because it means that you don't need to think that you have to make a start-up to say that you've created something. As long as it is something you're producing - no matter how small you may think it is, you've made it and you've created something. It's really quite exciting.

## My Maker List for 2016
I'm not going to go in to detail because I'd rather keep what I'm going to be working on under wraps. But I plan to write about them when finished, sometimes I may write about them in the process though depending on the project.

- Minimum 24 Blog Posts
- 1 Mac App
- 3 iOS Apps
- Produce a Beginner's Web Development Course - minimum 20 videos, does this count as 20 creations? ;)
- 2 AngularJS2 Web Apps
- 1 Big-Scale Web Service
- 3 WordPress Themes
	
I've added 3 WordPress themes to the end of the list as I still need to make my blog theme fully functional (add in comments etc.) but I also want to get more into WordPress development and so I am going to work on another two different unique themes that may be for clients or I could offer for free or even sell.

**Good luck to everyone else attempting [The 2016 Maker Challenge](http://megamaker.co/challenge/)üëç.**

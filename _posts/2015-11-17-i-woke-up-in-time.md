## Euuuughhh
I've been really struggling to sleep properly lately, which has resulted in really struggling to get out of bed in the mornings to go to the gym before work. Actually, I just haven't been going. Over the past 2 months I've managed to go about once a week on average, which is no good... especially when I've been eating crap the rest of the time. I prefer to go before work (around 5am), as much as I don't consider myself a morning person, because I know that I definitely would not do any exercise when I get home from work at around 6pm. And I believe (from past experience when I did stick to it) that getting up at 5 or 6am and exercising actually makes me feel much better throughout the day and I feel much more awake and energised. Although I wont feel like that for a few days as it is going to take me a few days to get back into and used to the routine, I just have to try my best now to stick to it.

So yeah, I got up at 5 today. I missed yesterday because the night before I couldn't sleep. But that's ok, as long as you start it doesn't matter (even though the little O.C.D in me is annoyed because I didn't start back at the beginning of the week).

Today was weight training day. It's long been advised that if you are looking to burn fat (especially a lot), that working your muscles is a very good way to go about it and to achieve results much quicker than purely focusing on cardio. It's because your muscles then keep your body working throughout the day and continue to burn energy rather than just whilst your at the gym like cardio... or something like that. There's much more science behind it but you can use [Google](http://google.co.uk) if you'd like to find out more.

My plan currently is to go 5 days a week (every weekday, weekends off as I'm sometimes away on weekends and don't want that to mess up my routine as it has in the past). Monday, Wednesday and Friday are cardio days whereby I run on a treadmill, go on the bike and do a sort of quick-paced cardio circuit. Tuesday and Thursday's I do weight & bodyweight training followed by a [Tabata run](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-intensity_interval_training).

For running I use [10K Runner by Fitness22](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/10k-runner-0-to-5k-to-10k/id456591673?mt=8) (formerly clearsky apps), [Motivo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/motivo-cycling-turbo-training/id578208463?mt=8) for the bike session and [FitnessBuilder](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/fitnessbuilder/id306287984?mt=8) for the cardio circuit as well as my weight training. Motivo is a good app, although it hasn't got any reviews (perhaps I should leave one..?) it's the only app I've found that isn't just for biking outside and can be used in the gym that comes with plans and routines. Right now I'm following the 20 minute HIIT training which is roughly 20 minutes 3 days a week. FitnessBuilder is awesome because it's like having a personal trainer in your pocket with loads of different plans you can follow, and if you need to pay for a monthly membership (some plans are premium, the ones I'm using right now are free) it's also much cheaper at just Â£5 a month. Lots of fitness apps just give you routines that are like 3 workouts or something, I hate that as you'd always be doing the same thing which isn't good for you. With FitnessBuilder you can get plans that go for weeks so you're always doing slightly different workouts, working different muscle groups and they get harder as you progress. Much better for fitness and you wont get bored either.

So yes, I made it. For the record today was:

* Dumbbells Week 1: Day 2
* Bodyweight Core Level Week 1: Day 2
* Tabata run x 1

My body stats from yesterday are as follows:

* <strong>Weight:</strong> 269.5lbs
* <strong>Lean Weight:</strong> 167.1lbs
* <strong>Body Fat (%):</strong> 38.0
* <strong>Body Fat (lbs):</strong> 102.4
* <strong>Chest:</strong> 46.25"
* <strong>Hips:</strong> 50"
* <strong>Waist:</strong> 49.5"
* <strong>Calf:</strong> 18"
* <strong>Thigh:</strong> 27"

I'm going to update my weight metrics each week on Mondays, and my body measurements every 4 weeks.

I've always wanted to some sort of assault course, there's different ones. Yesterday I started considering doing [Men's Health Survival of the Fittest](http://www.mhsurvival.co.uk) which starts in September... giving me about 10 months to train which should be plenty of time if I get my arse in gear. I even thought about doing all of the ones they do (in different cities) and doing it for charity or something. I feel if I commit to doing something like that, especially if I have people donating money to charity for me to do so... then I'll be much more likely to succeed. More on that later though.

Now I'm going to try not to pass out.

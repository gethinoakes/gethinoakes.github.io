I used to be really excited for Apple keynotes, today not so much. 

The last couple of Apple keynotes have in my opinion, been pretty underwhelming. Like watching a movie that you're not really into so you spend most of it looking at random crap on your phone underwhelming. 

I'm really hoping that today is different at WWDC. There are of course a few things that are pretty much a guarantee at this point, such as OS X being rebranded as Mac OS. I just hope that there are still some surprises, the day that "One more thing" comes back I'll probably squeel like a little girl. Although it could never be reproduced to a Steve Jobs standard. 

On the subject of WWDC, check out [this app](https://github.com/insidegui/WWDC){:target="_blank"}. you can download from GitHub that lets you watch the keynotes live stream and the following developer sessions, should be much nicer than watching in a browser (unless your lucky enough to have an Apple TV).

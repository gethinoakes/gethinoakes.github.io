## Losing Routine
Four weeks ago, on the 11th of January I started a fitness routine in order to get myself into shape. Running three times a week in the mornings and six days of P90 in the evenings after work.

In terms of sticking to that routine, the first two weeks went brilliantly. I did every workout, totalling nine for each week (and easily beat everyone to the top of my RunKeeper leaderboard ;) in the process).

However, I was getting very bad shin splints from running. I've experienced this before, and it really really hurts. In the third week I tried to push through the pain but it got to the point on the second day of running that I could barely walk or stand up or put any weight on my legs at all.

So I decided to stop running then and give myself just over a week off, which brings us to today. I went out again this morning and ran. My legs feel ok but my fitness has gone down from having that week off, so I had to revert to an earlier training day on my plan that had shorter intervals.

I plan on continuing my running but doing it week on, week off. I'll most likely have to repeat each training week too, which means it will take me four weeks just to do one week on the plan. But I guess this isn't a race, and the important thing is getting to get to the end (and keep going) and get fit in the process no matter how long it takes me.

With the pain in my legs and the lack of running also came the lack of motivation for my evening workouts, in week three I only did P90 four out of six times and in week four it was worse with just twice. Comine that with quite a few naughty take aways and the last two weeks of the first four were a complete failure.

## New Stats
In the past four weeks I've lost 6.7lbs in weight, around 1.5lbs a week. I was aiming for far more, even if this keeps inline with guidelines of not losing more than 2-2.5lbs per week.

What's really depressing is I lost 60-70% of that in the first week. I'm not sure if that means my starting weight was off for some reason or if after the first week things just went downhill badly.

I'll aim to improve my weekly loss over the next four weeks, although next week is going to be tough as I'll be back at the parents house with lots of food and no where to really do my P90...

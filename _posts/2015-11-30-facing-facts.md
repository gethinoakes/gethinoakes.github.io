I'm fat & lazy. This post should be titled "fat2fit week 2" but that would be a lie. Last week, just like the week before, I only went to the gym once. I ate out several times and just didn't control my diet at all. Sure, I kept to my healthy(ish) meals at lunchtime in work, but in between I didn't stop myself from snacking on the various goodies that are stocked for free in the kitchen.

It's not works fault, it's mine. I've allowed myself to get to this state and I'm finding it very difficult to break out of.

So of course this week I put on the pounds, but according to Withings my body fat has gone down which apparently means I've actually lost body fat since last week, again I don't trust it 100%. It is tempting though since it's in my favour.

This weeks stats are as follows:

* Weight: 266.3lbs (<span style="color: red;">+ 2lbs</span>)
* Lean Weight: 160.3lbs (<span style="color: green;">+ 4.1lbs</span>)
* Body Fat (%): 39.8 (<span style="color: green;">- 1.1%</span>)
* Body Fat (lbs): 106 (<span style="color: green;">- 2.1lbs</span>)

1 red and 3 green, so it isn't all bad. Apparently better than last week. Hopefully this doesn't make me complacent. 

With it being close to Christmas I've also realised that I'll be home with the family for around two weeks, which means I won't have easy access to a gym, thus I won't have access to weights to do my dumbbell workouts. And since I've been so crap at doing those lately I've decided to postpone doing those until I'm back in January, instead of starting, stopping and then having to start again.

Luckily I have a treadmill at home, so although I won't be able to continue my bike workouts either I can still run. Perhaps I'll try and run twice a day to make up for it.

I use (yet another) an app named PopWeight to track my stats. It's good because it tells you your progress in a way of suggesting how long it will take to reach your goal at your current weight and updates that estimate each time you weigh in.

At the moment it's saying 307 days, which is not good enough at all. Especially since last week it was 170 (still not good enough). Hopefully I can improve this estimate as the weeks go on.

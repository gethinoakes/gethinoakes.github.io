I don't think posting about my health publicly has helped me push forward or keep myself accountable at all. I've actually read that announcing your plans can have a negative affect and make it less likely for you to follow through but didn't see how that could be the case. I guess I'm evidence for that argument, for now at least.

I'll let the stats speak for themselves this week...

* Weight: 268.3lbs (<span style="color: red;">+ 2lbs</span>)
* Lean Weight: 156.7lbs (<span style="color: red;">- 3.6lbs</span>)
* Body Fat (%): 41.6 (<span style="color: red;">+ 1.8%</span>)
* Body Fat: 111.6lbs (<span style="color: red;">+ 5.6lbs</span>)

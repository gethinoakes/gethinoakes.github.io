Put the pitchforks and garlic away, I haven't turned into a vampire. Today marked the start of one of my 2016 goals: to get fit & healthy.

## Routine
I started my day at roughly 6am with an outside run. Then a morning shake for breakfast, shower etc. and head to work.

I'll be getting home from work at about 5.45 and then it's time to get started on my 13 weeks of P90 (6 days a week, Saturday being sort-of-optional).

### The Run
This is where the taste of blood came in. I understand it's not actually blood and just the metallic taste you can get when exercising hard. It takes me back to my school days when we used to do the bleep test... Fun times. If you don't know what it is firstly lucky you and secondly google it if you really must know.

I knew it would be hard as I've become very unfit but it was much harder than I was anticipating. I'm still getting over a bad cold I had over Christmas and New Year which didn't help. I was coughing so bad during and after my run I can't tell you how many times I almost threw up, which obviously doesn't help.

It was also very very cold (3deg Celsius), and I was wearing shorts. I didn't think beforehand to buy some running trousers, but that'll have to wait until payday now. Luckily I have a long-sleeved undershirt that I wore under a normal t-shirt to keep me a bit warmer.

### P90
Today was Sweat A and Ab Ripper A. Combined they total about 38 minutes. And now I'm sweaty. I thought P90 was supposed to be a walk in the park compared to P90X, P90X2 and P90X3 etc. but it isn't... although I am quite unfit so that would obviously make it harder. I tried not to perform the modified moves and only did so if I couldn't keep going for the last 10-15 seconds of an exercise. I burned 400 calories from doing both, about 220 more than on my run and my run was actually harder... so I guess that's a good thing!

I look forward to progressing throughout the weeks and getting to week 12!

### Diet
I said in a previous post that I can't really afford to buy a lot of healthy foods right now. But that doesn't mean I'm going to eat a lot of crap.

I'm going to start my days with a shake for breakfast. Lunch will be a ready meal but of the healthy (as healthy as possible) variety. Then dinner will be another shake. I'll fill the rest of my caloric needs with healthy snacks throughout the day such as fruit.

The shakes aren't protein shakes meant for building muscle and they are quite well-balanced in protein and carbs etc.

## Day 1 Stats
I'm going to follow the P90 structure of taking all body measurements & photos every 30 days / 4 weeks which is when I'll update them here. I'm going to weigh twice a week, Monday's and Thursday's, to keep track of my progress weekly.

Yesterday I passed the 6 month probationary period at Avecto which made me extremely happy. I love working there and I'm glad they like me being there too. 

I know have some good objectives for the next 6 months or so such as to keep progressing with JavaScript, AngularJS and Typescript but also to look to the future by taking a look at ES6 and AngularJS 2. I'm also going to look into Node.js.

I have a lot to learn, I'll keep posting along the way... but I'd better get to it. Hope you all have a good day.

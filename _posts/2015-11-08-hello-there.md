## Welcome...
To my website & blog. I've started this for a mix of reasons, but mainly so that I can write down notes I'm currently taking on my path to learning all things Javascript and relative frameworks/libraries. I'd like to thank [Wes Bos](http://wesbos.com/) for his [words of encouragement](https://github.com/wesbos/ama/issues/57) also as they were an extra push for me getting this online. Also, please bear with me with the current 'theme' I've developed. It's still a work in progress so things may be broken here and there (please let me know if you find something) but I'm going to develop a better theme when I have the time.

I graduated from university Around March 2015, and managed to secure myself a Graduate Software Engineer position at an amazing company named Avecto, an innovative technology business specialising in endpoint security. I work on front-end development there for some exciting new technologies. However, I was never really that well-versed in Javascript and as of right now I can just about get by with the limited understanding I have, but I'd like to change that and become as much of an expert as I can be and so I've scoured the internet and come across some great resources and suggested paths to follow.

I'm going to start by working my way through a free, but highly recommended book named [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/), it's especially great because it comes in several formats (PDF, ePub etc.) but you can also read it online on a very clean layout with code examples that you can actually edit and run right in the browser, and for me this just enhances the learning possibilities ten-fold. I was aiming to do a chapter a day at least 5 days a week but after doing the first three chapters I think that was a bit naive, especially as the chapters get longer and/or more complex. I'm going to try and aim for 2-3 chapters a week instead.

My current method right now is to read a chapter, and then go through it again making notes with pen and paper (you should see my hand writing, it is atrocious... 's' looks like /) and then I'm going to type up the notes I made into blog posts. So to anyone who reads them forgive me as they may be quite long, although I do try to keep my notes shorter than the actual chapters ðŸ˜ƒ. I'm doing this as I believe it will help with retention, which is something I've experienced trouble with when doing online video courses that don't really stimulate you or aren't interactive in any way.

I hope when I look back on this post in 6 months to a year I'll be happy at what I've achieved.

Apart from that, I'll also use this space to write about anything else I find interesting or anything that annoys me (there may be a lot), I'm also going to use it to post about my health as I'm trying to get fit and lose a lot of weight I hope putting it out there will motivate me more to succeed. 

Thanks for reading.

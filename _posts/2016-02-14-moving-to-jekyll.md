Keeping in line with my apparent inability to stand still with this blog, I've decided to move it from [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) to [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).

Wordpress is web software primarily used to create blogs, although it can pretty much power any type of website these days. Jekyll is a creation from the folks at Github, and it is meant as a tool to create static websites rather than rely on backend code and databases (which is one of the benefits).

## Why?
There are two main reasons for choosing to do this...

### Self Development
I've glanced at Jekyll before, and I was a little intimidated. Now I'm a bit more experienced I decided to take another look, and a better look at that. 

I wanted to develop my blog using Jekyll to improve my own knowledge and to learn a different type of development, and I'm quite happy with what I've discovered, even if I've only really just scratched the surface.

I plan to keep delving into Jekyll not to only improve my personal site but also to potentially use it for client sites, granted that they don't need a CMS to manage content themselves.

### Speed
As great as Wordpress is, it does come with a lot of dependencies that my blog simply doesn't need. Jekyll creates static content, almost as lightweight as it can get minus the loading of font awesome and google fonts.

I ran tests on my Wordpress blog and my new Jekyll blog using [GTMetrix]() and [Pingdom]() which are both high up in the first 10 Google results when you search for 'Website Performance'.

The results speak for themselves;

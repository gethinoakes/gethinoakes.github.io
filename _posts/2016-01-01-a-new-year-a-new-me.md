First of all, Happy New Year everyone! I hope you all had a good one.

## New Blog Design
Secondly, if you've been here before - you may have noticed the place looks a bit different. I really wasn't happy with the old design because of one major design flaw, on screens any bigger than a tablet anyway.

There was the sidebar, and then the posts to the right of that. I kept the width of the posts to a minimum so that text lines weren't too long. Because of this there was just masses of empty space and on my monitor this was more than half the page.

![new design](http://www.gethinoakes.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Screenshot-2016-01-01-22.56.25-1-1024x513.png)

So I decided to go with this fresh new design, it's a current trend and I can see why because it keeps things clean with good use of white space and has a minimalist feel which I love.

I also took out clutter that I didn't feel was needed such as the extra pages about me and contact and social icons, now on the home page there's a little brief about me at the top which is more than enough and links to my twitter and email if people do want to get in touch which removes the need for all of that extra fluff.

It still needs a bit of work, mainly so it works correctly on mobile devices... but I wanted to get it up today to start the new year with.

## New Year Resolutions
Everybody makes new years resolutions, but hardly anybody follows through with them. In fact I saw [some statistics](http://www.statisticbrain.com/new-years-resolution-statistics/) the other day that only 8% do... which isn't too hard to believe.

I'm going to try to be part of that 8% in 2016. I have a lot that I want to achieve this year, maybe too much but I really want to spend the year working on myself... as hippy as that sounds.

## Why?
In 2015 I graduated from University with a 1st class honours (I don't know how I managed that), and was very fortunate to get a job at an amazing company. I know I'm extremely fortunate with both of these events, but to be honest I'm not as happy with my life as I'd like to be - part of the blame lies with myself.

I've become extremely lazy over the past few years and too complacent. Especially since starting my job I get home and then just watch TV or play on my Xbox and repeat for the whole week. Weekends aren't any better.

This is affecting all aspects of my life, my health, my social life and even financial and it has to stop.

## My Goals
My first goal this year is to give myself the much-needed kick up the arse that I need to get myself out of my lazy habits and lifestyle, which is going to be the hardest of all.

Of the most clich√© I want very much to get my health back on track and lose all of the fat I've managed to pile on over the past 2 years. I really can't believe I've let myself get to the state I am right now. I know I have previous posts on weight loss, but this really has to be it now. I have a plan of sorts together and am going to stick to it best I can. Unfortunately for me diet (as in eating healthy, not calorie counting) is a large part of getting healthy... and I can barely afford to feed myself as it is. So diet is what I'm going to struggle with most, but hopefully as the year goes on I'll be able to afford to eat better foods.

My job is primary JavaScript, which I've spent the past few months trying to get to grips with as well as AngularJS and Typescript. This year I'm going to try to really focus on becoming a real JavaScript developer as I still feel like I don't know what I'm doing (although is that the curse of the programmer?).

I don't want to leave it there though. I still have a huge interest in iOS development, and I have quite a few half-developed apps that I want to finish this year and get in the app store. The first few may be simple, but it's more about actually getting them done and creating something than how complicated they are.

Following on from this theme, I also have a huge web project that I am going to be working on throughout the year. It will also include a mobile application but I want to get the website finished first. I already started working on the design at the beginning of December, but I need to learn more JavaScript first. I want to make it a completely JavaScript application, front end and backend, although I am also considering Ruby on Rails for the project as that language has always interested me.

And any free time I have I want to develop more of a web portfolio, I have some clients lined up to develop websites for and I hope to keep this going throughout 2016.

## How?
One way I am going to do this is to spend my evenings after work exercising and working on the above goals below instead of lying in bed watching TV or playing games.

Another is to use an app to keep track of my goals and mark when I do or do not do them on any given day. This way I can see visually at an instant if I am on a path to productivity or giving into laziness again.

In regards to getting fit; I'm going to escape the treadmills and start running outside again, 3 days a week following a 10k plan which lasts 14 weeks but I plan to repeat each week as I'm currently so unfit so it will take me longer.

I'm also going to attempt all of the popular P90 programs by BeachBody this year. There are 4 of them which are 90 days each so this would take more than the entire year. It is a massive challenge.

In regards to becoming a better/proper JavaScript developer I am currently about halfway through the Eloquent JS book that I have been reading and making notes on. I plan to continue and I got a hard copy of the book for Christmas which will make it easier. From there I will focus on bettering my understanding of what I have learnt as well as going on to study AngularJS and Typescript in depth.

I will need to get back into iOS programming to finish off my unfinished apps and also develop new apps I have ideas for. I'm going to skip Objective-C now and focus on learning Swift as it is now 2 years old and open sourced I believe it's a good time to leave Objective-C behind. This will mean re-writing what I have done in Swift but that will make for a good learning experience.

I can't divulge much about the biggest project I want to undertake. But this will be developed as I grow as a developer.

I'm going to try and expand myself as a freelancer and keep getting clients throughout the year to build my portfolio, I'm going to attempt this by putting myself out there more.

## Summary
What's most important this year to me is getting my health back on track and just creating, it doesn't really matter what it is. I just want to make things, I no longer want to just consume tv or games or whatever it is.

Good luck to anyone else who has New Years Resolutions, here's to us being part of the 8%...
